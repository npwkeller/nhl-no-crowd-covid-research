ECON 1700 Capstone Project - Researching Home Ice Advantage during Covid-19 Seasons without a Crowd

Exteneded current literature on home ice advantage and covid-19's impact looking at it within the context of the NHL as there were no crowds.

Abstract: 
This study quantitatively examines the impact of crowd absence on home team performance in the National Hockey League (NHL), focusing on the COVID-19-affected 2020-2021 seasons. Using the natural experiment of Covid-19, we ran numerous linear regression models to assess the impact of having no fans in attendance, while also controlling for playoff games, close matchups, and using fixed effects for team matchups. Our analysis reveals a significant negative effect on home team performance during playoff games played without a crowd, indicating a 0.5155 goal advantage for the away team. The impact of regular season game results without fans is less conclusive but saw some negative relationships to the home teamâ€™s performance. These effects were mitigated when controlling for matchups suggesting historical team advantages, independent of crowd presence. Overall, our findings underscore the practical importance of fan attendance in bolstering home team performance, particularly during playoff environments, contributing valuable insights into the Covid-19 impacted NHL seasons.
